## Disable Predictable Network Interface names and use eth0

## This script disables "predictable interface names" like enp0s3,
## and restores the use of interface names like eth0.
## This seems to be needed if we use the virtualbox-ovf source,
## otherwise networking does not start on any VM created by the
## exported .ova file. The following issue gave the clue:
##   https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/866
## and the solution was picked up from:
##   https://github.com/chef/bento/blob/master/packer_templates/debian/scripts/networking.sh

echo "Disabling predictable network interface names..."
## This script assumes that the names of all interfaces in
## /etc/network/interfaces will be replaced with eth0. This works
## for us, because we use only one interface connected to a NAT
## network.
sed -i 's/en[[:alnum:]]*/eth0/g' /etc/network/interfaces;
## Add kernel parameter to disable predictable interface names
