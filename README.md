amd64 VM images for the kutti Oracle VirtualBox driver

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kuttiproject/driver-vbox-images?include_prereleases)

This repository contains build instructions and Packer scripts for building images for the kutti VirtualBox driver running on amd64 Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Its releases are the download source of these images for the kutti system.

## Image Kubernetes Versions

We will try and maintain images for the current Kubernetes version, and two earlier minor versions. Versions older than that will be deprecated, and eventually removed.

## Building Images

Images can be built by manually following the instructions in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md), or by running the Packer scripts as detailed in [PACKER.md](PACKER.md).

## Releases

Details of creating releases can be found in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

## Release Versioning

Releases will usually follow the major and minor version number of the [driver-vbox](https://github.com/kuttiproject/driver-vbox) project. Sometimes, this repository's releases may lag by a version.

## Components

The images in this repository are built from open source components. Details can be found in [COMPONENTS.md](COMPONENTS.md).
